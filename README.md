### Solana Civ

Fully on-chain proof of concept inspired by Sid Meier's Civilization.
In SolanaCiv, players use smart contracts to manage their civilization by building structures, recruiting workers and units, and fighting off barbarians.
Players earn resources (SPL tokens) like gold, food, and lumber through smart contract that simulate resource generation. The game is turn-based, with each turn representing 1 day. Players can perform many actions (transactions) per turn: move units, build, fight, upgrade and more.

#### Run locally

### Game design

#### Initialization
- When a player joins, frontend generates a burner wallet and funds it with 1 devnet SOL
- Smart contract initializes the civilization with a starting amount of $GOLD, $FOOD, $LUMBER, 1 worker and 1 scout. Assets are soulbound to a game session and cannot be transferred to a different game session or wallet.
- One city is automatically built for each civilization upon joining.

#### Turn mechanics
- At the start of each turn, players receive (or lose) resources based on their current buildings and units to maintain.
- Players can then choose actions for their workers, soldiers and cities. Every action is an on-chain transaction that triggers the smart contract. Players can: construct a building, recruit units, move units on the global map, send soldiers to fight barbarians.

#### Construction
- Building a structure costs $LUMBER and/or $GOLD. Some structures can be built only by workers on the global map, other directly in the city.
- Construction time is constant for each structure and depends on number of turns.

#### Resource gathering
- $GOLD, $FOOD, and $LUMBER generation occurs at the beginning of each turn, affected by the number and type of buildings and units.

#### Tokens
- 🪙 $GOLD - currency for trading, building and maintenance.
- 🌽 $FOOD - needed for recruiting.
- 🪵 $LUMBER - required for constructing buildings.
